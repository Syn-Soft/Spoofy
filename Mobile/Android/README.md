# Android Version
This version will likely be written in Java or Kotlin

Main page, on start, will be the discovery page: Recent albums/songs (jump back in), Suggested new music (which will require some ML), etc.

Bottom panel will have an overlaid player,
very bottom will be a bottom navigation menu.  Thus the layout will be a bottom navigation.
